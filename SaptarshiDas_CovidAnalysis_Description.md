About Covid-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

COVIDâ€‘19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.

## The Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize the trends in covid-19 cases across the world from March 2020 to February 2022. The project has used the dataset provided in another Github account, following is the repository link: [Covid-19 dataset](https://github.com/laxmimerit/Covid-19-Preprocessed-Dataset).
Several plots and visualizations have been used to represent and analyze using Python modules such as Plotly, Folium and data manipulation modules like Pandas and Numpy.
